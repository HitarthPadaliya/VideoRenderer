# VIDEO RENDERER

This is a specialized helper tool for my YouTube channel: [3DLand]([https://](https://www.youtube.com/@Land3D5447)).

It is used to create code slides for my tutorials.

**Features**: MacOS-styled blurred window, syntax highlighting, window and text animations.

## Dependencies

1. Visual Studio 2026 with "Desktop Development with C++" workload
2. DirectXTK source
3. FFmpeg full-shared

Download these separately. Place the respective folders in the Dependencies folder. Also copy the ffmpeg binaries to the output folder.
